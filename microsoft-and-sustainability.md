## Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)

Microsoft has signed the largest-ever corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) for renewable energy, securing over **10.5 gigawatts (GW)** of capacity in the United States and Europe \[[1](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/05/02/microsoft-announces-largest-corporate-procurement-of-renewables/)]. This massive investment is set to begin construction in 2026 and is estimated to cost over $11.5 billion \[[1](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/05/02/microsoft-announces-largest-corporate-procurement-of-renewables/)].

### Innovative Partnerships

* **ENGIE Collaboration**: Microsoft has partnered with ENGIE to purchase 230 megawatts (MW) from two renewable projects in Texas, including the 200 MW Las Lomas wind project \[[2](https://news.microsoft.com/2019/09/24/microsoft-and-engie-announce-innovative-renewable-initiatives/)].
* **Qcells Alliance**: In collaboration with Qcells, Microsoft is working to build a strong U.S. solar supply chain. This partnership aims to generate at least 2.5 GW of solar panels and related services to power over 400,000 homes \[[3](https://news.microsoft.com/2023/01/25/microsoft-and-qcells-announce-strategic-alliance-to-curb-carbon-emissions-and-power-the-clean-energy-economy/)].

### Carbon-Free Energy Initiatives

Microsoft also focuses on adding carbon-free electricity to the grids where it operates. For example, a recent PPA with Constellation will enable a Pennsylvania 835 MW nuclear facility to restart, contributing to a more reliable and carbon-free electricity supply \[[4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2024/09/20/accelerating-the-addition-of-carbon-free-energy-an-update-on-progress/)].

## Global Impact

Microsoft’s renewable energy projects span 24 countries, with a total contracted renewable energy portfolio of **34 GW \[**[4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2024/09/20/accelerating-the-addition-of-carbon-free-energy-an-update-on-progress/)]. This global approach ensures that Microsoft’s operations are powered by clean energy, significantly reducing its carbon footprint.

### AI and Technology Integration

Microsoft leverages AI and machine learning to optimize energy use and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These technologies help balance energy demand and supply in real time, making renewable energy more efficient and reliable \[[5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability/energy)].
